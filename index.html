                            I've just graduated with my master's degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Illinois Institute 
                            of Technology in Chicago. <br><br>
                            In this last academic year, I got the opportunity to co-author a research paper where I did stereological 
                            analysis on binder jet 3D printed stainless steel parts. I enjoyed being able to expand my skills into the 
                            world of material science and look forward to its publication! <br><br> 
                            Some of my favorite skills include CAD, finite element analysis, stereological analysis, 3D printing, laser 
                            cutting and python for all your programming needs. <br><br>
                            I have a passion for designing and creating just about anything and would consider myself a maker at heart. 
                            Within my graduate education I specialized in CAD-CAM and love using my skills to create inventions to feed 
                            my 3D printing addiction. <br><br>
                            On any given day you can catch me rock climbing, playing board games and troubleshooting 3D printing 
                            projects! Check out the portfolio below to see what I've been working on <(˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ )>

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">After getting my own personal 3D printer, this novelty chess set idea was the 
                            first major project I decided to undertake. <br> <br>
                            My vision for the chess set was for it to be portable with embedded storage for the pieces. This would 
                            prevent the pieces from needing to be kept in a separate compartment like most other portable chess sets I 
                            had researched. Additionally, I wanted it to be entirely 3D printed as an added constraint to test how far 
                            I could push the designs. <br> <br>
                            Having played my fair share of online chess, I thought why not simply have physical 2D tokens for the 
                            pieces that are stored in their starting positions. With this in mind set out to make the whole board fold 
                            up to store and transport the set like a pop-up book.

                        </p>

                        <img class="img-thumbnail-3x" src="assets/img/3dchess/board-assem.png" alt="..." />
                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> The tools I used for the CAD/CAM of this project are as follows: Autodesk 
                            Inventor for CAD, Inkscape to design the piece icons, Cura for slicing and my Ender 3 3D printer for part 
                            production. I started by designing the board squares and figuring out how I would make them fit together. 
                            Since I would be using white and black PLA for the different square colors, they all needed to be individual 
                            parts. <br> <br>
                            Firstly, to join the squares together I thought a fun solution would be to use buckles. This would also 
                            allow for non-permanent joining of different board squares in case I wanted to change something or reprint 
                            a part. To achieve the folding function, I used double jointed hinges to allow 
                            for a perfectly flat fold of the board on top of itself. Additionally, I added half circle cavities between 
                            some of the squares just below the top surface to allow for the insertion of small neodymium magnets. While 
                            the magnets are not 3D printed, it felt like the most elegant solution to prevent the board sections from 
                            swinging apart during transportation. The final functional element was making the storage cavities for the 
                            chess pieces. I originally designed the pieces to have circular bases but quickly changed them to square to 
                            maximize the space used. This allowed for better sized icons.    
                        
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-thumbnail-3x" src="assets/img/3dchess/piece-assem.png" alt="..." />
                        <img class="img-thumbnail-3x" src="assets/img/3dchess/piece-assem-open.png" alt="..." />
                        <img class="img-thumbnail-3x" src="assets/img/3dchess/piece-assem-expanded.png" alt="..." />
                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> Playing off of the pop-up book inspiration I thought it would be unique if 
                            the pieces themselves folded out into 2.5D projections of the icons. With this in mind I designed a 
                            three-part mechanism that allowed for the piece icon to fold flat for storage and up during play. <br> <br>
                            The pieces consist of standard base and lever parts with a unique icon part. The lever arm rotates at the 
                            bottom of the base allowing for the sliding joints of the icon to flip the piece out into playing position.                            

                        </p>

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> Using a 3D printing layer height of 0.16mm the final prototype was 
                            constructed. Total part count of the chess set was 196 individually printed parts. <br> <br>
                            Following standard chess square sizing, the board squares are 5cm wide. Each board square is 1cm thick. 
                            When unfolded this results in board dimensions of 40cm X 40cm X 1cm. When folded the dimensions are 
                            20cm X 20cm X 4cm. The chess piece assemblies are 3.74cm wide and 0.3cm thick. When unfolded into play 
                            position the pieces height from the board surface is ~3cm.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">In this project I worked in a team of four to develop a telescoping pole with 
                            interchangeable heads for disk golf retrieval. My job was to develop the CAD model of the telescoping 
                            arm for use in finite element analysis. <br> <br>
                            I knew that we would be adjusting the design based on the FEA results. With that in mind I wanted 
                            a CAD model that allowed for easy and quick adjustment for iterative FEA testing. To achieve this, I designed 
                            the whole assembly to be fully parameter driven. Major design variables are carried from the core pole section 
                            to all five larger sections.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> Using the parameter function in Autodesk Inventor, I developed the parts to be 
                            interdependent and based off the parent core section. The most important of the design variables are the thickness 
                            and length of the sections. <br> <br>
                            The full assembly is constructed of a core section that has a securing outward lip at the back and the threaded 
                            mounting hole at the front. There are then four identical middle sections with both outward and inward facing lips 
                            on respective ends. The final sixth end section only has an inward securing lip and a hollow back. A simple 
                            plastic end cap is placed at the end to enclose the assembly. to allow for the adjustment of all sections 
                            independently there are five clamps of appropriate size for each inner section to be secured when at desired length.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> The parameter driven assembly allowed for extremely simple design adjustments. 
                            The first two images above are of the assembly with the optimized thickness and length. Using aluminum for the design constraints, 
                            we found 1/32in thickness was more than adequate. Total length collapsed is ~3ft and extended is ~14.5ft. <br> <br>
                            The third image shows how the assembly automatically adjusts to the wall thickness of the sections being changed from 1/32in to 5in.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> I used Python to program the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics 
                            (SINDy) algorithm to identify nonlinear differential equations from the Waleffe-Kim-Hamilton (WKH) model of 
                            transition and sustained turbulence. The WKH model is defined by the following system of equations.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> In the state vector 𝑥, 𝑢 is the amplitude of the spanwise modulation of 
                            streamwise velocity, 𝑣 is the amplitude of streamwise rolls, 𝑤 is the amplitude of the inflection streak 
                            instability and 𝑚 is the amplitude of the mean shear. These will be the fundamental variables monitored in 
                            the analysis of the WHK model. In the A matrix, the constants 𝜆, 𝜇, 𝜈, 𝜎, correspond to positive viscous 
                            decay rates. 𝑅𝑒 is the Reynolds number. 𝑄(𝑥) contains the constants 𝛾 and 𝛿 which are nonlinear interaction 
                            coefficients of equal sign. <br> <br>
                            To recreate the WKH model from simulated experimental data the SINDy function will be used. This algorithm 
                            will be of the form shown below.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> Where Θ(𝑋) is a library of possible nonlinear functions and the columns of 
                            matrix Ξ are the vectors of active coefficients. The determination of the coefficients should allow for 
                            the reconstruction of the original dynamical system based solely off of the simulated experimental data. In 
                            the above figure the SINDy algorithm is visualized for the Lorenz System for greater clarity.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4"> <br> Overall, the SINDy algorithm has been shown to successfully recreate the WKH 
                            system with varying parameter sets and noise levels. For the scale of tests done over the course of this 
                            project the SINDy function seems to be very robust and only had a meaningful error in one parameter set 
                            under strange conditions. With further testing these results could be improved. More extensive testing 
                            could be carried out using this code with extreme examples of the WKH system. The SINDy function results 
                            may be improved with the use of a more efficient numerical derivative methods more geared toward use with 
                            SINDy. I feel that the experimental system could be even further improved with the additional use of 
                            traditional data methods such as smoothing and interpolation to clean up the noisier results.
